# Lab 8 - Finalizing my Learning Portfoloio  

1. What is the purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)

        The purpose of this repository was to build and maintain a portfolio
of all the topics and technologies I've learned in this course. It serves as a 
way of seeing how much I've learned. It also provides references that will be
useful if I need to remember something (jquery, mongodb, etc).

2. What was your favorite lab or assignemnt and why?
        
        My favorite assignment was assignment 3. This assignment was captivating
because it felt like I was finally able to see inside the black box: I could 
get to understand how servers work. It was also my favorite assignment because
it presented many difficult challenges, like using a database, and I learned a 
lot by struggling through the hard work.

3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

        On day 1, I felt like a could make a basic website using HTML and css.
By now, I feel like I could create a full web app - both client side and 
server side. I feel comfortable using databases, and I have a much better sense
about how to develop secure websites. Most importantly, I feel like I have a 
solid grasp of how the web really works, which I did not expect to get out of 
course (I thought we would simply learn how to build simple websites).

4. What was the most important thing you learned in this course? Cite two 
examples as evidence.

        The most important thing I learned in this course is developing websites
with security in mind. The big breakthrough came from developing a custom 
sign-up/login system for my group's semester project. I learned about how to 
store passwords securely in a database and manage cookies. Another big 
moment was working on assignment 4 and seeing how easily my early websites could
be hacked, and how many vulnerabilities I could find in other websites. It
really highlighted the importance of building websites with security in mind 
during all stages of design and implementation.

5. Now that you've finished the course, what topic would you like to delve 
deeper into?

        Now that I have a much better understanding of how the web works, I feel
like my biggest gap in understanding is how to make the web more secure. So, 
naturally, the next topic I'd like to delve into is computer security. 
Encryption has always been something that fascinates me, but I'm starting to see
that there is so much more to security.
