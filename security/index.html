        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>     The product is a website that offers location checkin. Users
                can check in at their geolocation, and receive information 
                about other users and nearby historical landmarks. I was
                hired to find vulnerabilities in this product.
        </p>
        
        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <p>     My methodology was to post information to the login page
                (/sendLocation) in order to see what kind of malicious information I can get into the database. I also attempted to see howmuch information I could post (in an attempt to overwhelm the server or website). I used curl to pen test
                this page as well as shell scripting to run many tests
                simultaneously to simulate a DDoS attack of sorts.
        </p>
        
        <h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
        <p>  
                DDoS Attack Vulnerability: The server does not handle multiple requests effectively. A hacker who simply sends information to the server often is able to crash the site within a minute. This forces the server to be restarted in order for the website to function, which results in a lot of downtime.
                XXS Vulnerability: By sending specific information to the login page, a hacker is able to cause the homepage and the /checkins.json page to redirect to whatever website they want.
