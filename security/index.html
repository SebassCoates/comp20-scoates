        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>     The product is a website that offers location checkin. Users
                can check in at their geolocation, and receive information 
                about other users and nearby historical landmarks. I was
                hired to find vulnerabilities in this product.
        </p>
        
        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <p>     My methodology was to post information to the login page
                (/sendLocation) in order to see what kind of malicious information I can get into the database. I also attempted to see howmuch information I could post (in an attempt to overwhelm the server or website). I used curl to pen test
                this page as well as shell scripting to run many tests
                simultaneously to simulate a DDoS attack of sorts.
        </p>
        
        <h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
        <p>  
                DDoS Attack Vulnerability: The server does not handle multiple requests effectively. A hacker who simply sends information to the server often is able to crash the site within a minute. This forces the server to be restarted in order for the website to function, which results in a lot of downtime.
                XXS Vulnerability: By sending specific information to the login page, a hacker is able to cause the homepage to redirect to whatever website they want. Furthermore, the Landmarks website that relies on this server can now display unsolicited messages (like advertisements) that have been added by hackers.
        </p>
