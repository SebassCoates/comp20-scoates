# ASSIGNMENT 2 - LANDMARKS

1. Implementation:
        All aspects of the assignment are implemented and working.

2. Collaboration: 
        I worked on my own for this assignment. Ming's Piazza post (109)
        about "this" in Javascript and sample code helped me to fix a bug
        where event handling was not properly managed.

3. Time Spent:
        5 Hours.
